# LoyaltyPrime
 
-This is a proof of conept project for Loyalty Prime technical interview.

This is a simple C# Widnows Form program that simulates a reward points system, 
the user is able to:
       -Create new cusstomer accounts
       -Delete existing cusstomer accounts
       -Create new reward account for an existing customer
       -Delete existing reward account for an existing customer
       -Add points to an existing account
       -Redeem points that customer has accumulated
       
HOW TO RUN:
   1. A script must be run that will create a new database and any preliminary tables/data
        -The script is located in the SCRIPTS folder.
   3. The executable can be used for running the program and testing its functionality.
        -Executable can be located in the bin/Debug directory.
        
        
        
As this is a proof of concept and not a finished product there are still a number of improvements that can be made.
I have also left out certain exception handling for readabilities sake as we are under the assumption that the scrip gets run and all relevant data is there.
